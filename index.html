          <p>
            I'm an aspiring developer looking for new and exciting
            opportunities. Coming from a diverse studying and working
            background, I'm a genuinely curious learner that loves combating new
            challanges. If you take a look at my resume you will find that this
            is not just a clich√© - I really do live to learn and I never back
            away from what's outside of my comfort zone. I dare to say that this
            is one of my greatest strenghts - I'm never a stranger to new ideas,
            new perspectives or new skills to develop. Also, I've been described
            as "quite nice" by anonymous sources which is a quality I pride
            myself with.

                Wanting to learn MERN stack from scratch, I and two friends began working on LendBox - an app where users can browse and lend board games free of charge. Parts of the projects are made with the help from the course <a href = "https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react" target = "_blank"class = "textLinks">Mastering React.</a> The project is a work in progress and as of now we're working on the UI and focusing on the React part. The goal is to connect the frontend with a backend using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. You can find LendBox <a href = "https://johanahsberg.github.io/LendBoxPublic/?fbclid=IwAR2RN-Ucrm1bLxqq2NOe4O5SW37Njt26xvF45BUiQJcvNYrNq6gPfyRzXs8#/Home" class = "textLinks" target = "_blank">here.</a><br><br>Our GitHub repo can be found <a href = "https://github.com/Johanahsberg/LendBoxPublic" target = "_blank"class = "textLinks">here.</a>

                Vidly is a fake movie renting service created with React. The project was made as a part of the course <a href = "https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react" target = "_blank"class = "textLinks">Mastering React.</a> Users can register and they are then given authorization to update the movies. If the user is an admin they can also add and delete movies. Movies can be searched for using the search bar or by filtering by genre. Pagination as well as sorting is dynamic and movies can be liked/unliked. The HTTP client I used is Axios and I'm using Joi for frontend validation. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. The code for the backend is provided by <a href = "https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node" class = "textLinks" target = "_blank">Mosh Hamedani</a> which is the creator of the course <a href = "https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react" target = "_blank"class = "textLinks">Mastering React.</a><br> Below is a short demo of how the app works.
